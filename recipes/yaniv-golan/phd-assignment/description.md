# PhD Assignment Workflow

This workflow streamlines the process of analyzing multiple academic papers for PhD research by combining AI tools to summarize PDFs, organize findings, and generate comprehensive answers to research questions.

## Overview

The workflow orchestrates three powerful AI tools in sequence:

1. **Claude** for intelligent PDF analysis and summarization
2. **Google Docs** for organizing and structuring summaries
3. **ChatGPT** for synthesizing findings and generating answers

## Key Benefits

1. **Time Efficiency**
   - Automated paper summarization
   - Structured organization of findings
   - Quick synthesis of multiple sources

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Consistent summary structure
   - Focus on key research elements
   - Cross-paper synthesis
   - Identification of research gaps

3. **Research Quality**
   - Systematic approach to literature review
   - Standardized summary format
   - Clear traceability to source materials
   - Structured final analysis

4. **Flexibility**
   - Customizable summary prompts
   - Adaptable to different research fields
   - Scalable to any number of papers
   - Support for various research questions

## Best Practices

1. **PDF Preparation**
   - Ensure PDFs are text-searchable
   - Organize papers by topic or theme
   - Use consistent file naming
   - Verify PDF quality before processing

2. **Summary Organization**
   - Use consistent section headers
   - Add keywords and tags
   - Include page references
   - Maintain clear paper attribution

3. **Research Question**
   - Be specific and focused
   - Define clear scope
   - Include relevant parameters
   - Consider sub-questions

This workflow is particularly valuable for PhD students and researchers conducting literature reviews, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. It provides a structured approach to processing large volumes of academic literature while maintaining high standards of research quality.
