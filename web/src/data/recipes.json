This recipe uses Claude for query generation, Perplexity for research, and ChatGPT for synthesis to create comprehensive competitive analysis reports.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Ensure you have access to:\n   - Claude (3.5 Sonnet or higher)\n   - Perplexity (Pro recommended)\n   - ChatGPT (GPT-4)\n   - Google Docs\n\n2. Define your parameters:\n\n   ```yaml\n   company_name: \"SimpliSafe\"              # Your company\n   target_industry: \"Smart home security\"   # Your industry\n   competitors: \"ADT, Ring, Vivint\"        # Key competitors\n   ```\n\n3. Follow the workflow:\n   1. Generate competitor research queries with Claude\n   2. Set up Google Doc with proper formatting\n   3. Execute research in Perplexity\n   4. Synthesize competitive assessment with ChatGPT\n\n## Time & Difficulty\n\n- **Time to Execute**: 15-20 minutes\n- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate\n- **Tools Required**: 4 (Claude, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Google Docs)\n\n## Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |\n|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| company_name | Yes | Your company's name | \"SimpliSafe\" |\n| target_industry | Yes | Industry to analyze | \"US smart home security market\" |\n| competitors | No | Key competitors to focus on | \"ADT, Ring, Vivint\" |\n\n## Workflow Steps\n\n### 1. Query Generation (Claude)\n\nGenerates 5 focused competitor analysis queries covering:\n\n- Market share and revenue comparison\n- Product and pricing analysis\n- Marketing strategies\n- Financial performance\n- Customer feedback and satisfaction\n\n### 2. Document Setup (Google Docs)\n\nCreates structured document for competitive research:\n\n- Title format: \"[Date] - [Industry] - Competitive Analysis\"\n- Example: \"2024-11-25 - Smart Home Security - Competitive Analysis\"\n- Organized sections for each competitor aspect\n\n### 3. Research Execution (Perplexity)\n\nSystematically gathers competitor data:\n\n- Documents competitive insights\n- Maintains structured data collection\n\n### 4. Competitive Assessment (ChatGPT)\n\nGenerates comprehensive analysis covering:\n\n- Competitive Landscape\n- Strategic Analysis\n- Competitive Dynamics\n\n## Output Structure\n\nThe final assessment includes:\n\n```markdown\n# Competitive Assessment Report\n\n## 1. Competitive Landscape\n- Market Share Analysis\n- Positioning Comparison\n- Key Player Profiles\n\n## 2. Strategic Analysis\n- Product/Service Comparison\n- Pricing Strategies\n- Go-to-Market Approaches\n\n## 3.
